title: About Me

## Background

- I started with Android app development in 2017, out of the curiosity to run *'my own app on my phone'*. Starting with simpler apps like a flashlight, battery-full alarm, a TODO app, I levelled up by learning Firebase, `RecyclerView` and new Jetpack components by the beginning of 2019. This was at our home in Thane, India.

- In the mid of 2018, I saw this video by [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/@ColdFusion) titled [What is Artificial Intelligence Exactly?](https://youtu.be/kWmX3pd1f10?feature=shared) and was mind-blown by the concept of AI. I started exploring ML, eventually discovering `scikit-learn` and TensorFlow through [Josh Gordon's Machine Learning Recipes playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&feature=shared) on YT. I dived deep into ML and TensorFlow, until 2019, when I realized: *"Why not build an Android app that uses my text-classifier built with TF?"*

- This led me into on-device ML, specifically, TensorFlow Lite at the moment. TF Lite was pretty young back then, and didn't even support RNN/LSTM operations. To execute my models on live camera-feed, I learnt the newly introduced [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camerax) library. In 2020, I built my first *popular* on-device ML project, [FaceRecognition_With_FaceNet_Android](https://github.com/shubham0204/FaceRecognition_With_FaceNet_Android) which now has the highest number of ‚≠ê across my GitHub repos.

- Now in 2020, our schools shut down due to COVID, and I got an opportunity to intern at [AjnaLens](https://www.ajnalens.com/). The experience was novel, as for the first time, an hobbyist programming kid was working with employees of a startup, and getting paid! The year went on, with me getting my first freelancing project from [Daniel Vadranapu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-vadranapu/) in which I had to modify some parts of my face-recognition project. I got many gigs following that, for the same project. In 2021, I had my JEE and CET exams that are important in getting admission to a undergrad course at a good university in India. I managed to pass those exams with good marks (*above-average kind of*) and started my undergraduate course in CS at a college in Pune, India in December 2021.

- Fast forward to 2023, at college, I formally studied subjects like OOP (with C++), DBMS, CN and DSA that strengthened my knowledge and allowed me to think outside of the Android-ML world in which I had lived for the past 4 years. Understanding how memory-management and operating-systems worked, got me into low-level programming. I was now able to understand what GCC, ABIs, CPU architectures, VMs meant and how compilation strategies of languages like C/C++ and Java were different from each other. With the knowledge of databases and CN, backend development felt interesting, and I used [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) to build some toy projects for myself. 

## Motivation

- I like the way we make computer learn things that we as humans *may or not learn*, and solve some unbelievable problems with those capabilities. The Math behind ML, which I call *The Mathematics of Intelligence* is fascinating as it backs theoretical assumptions and inner workings of all learning. The process of modelling the process of *learning* with mathematics is equally fascinating to me. 

- For me, on-device ML started as an intersection of two things that I liked, but eventually, I believe that is the end-product of a much *obvious* process that happens in tech all the time, *miniaturization*. Making things work in smaller settings and with the same or enhanced power is fascinating to me. On-device ML or mobile-ML is a great way of achieving miniaturization of larger ML models.
